# Scaling the Job Scheduler Microservice

This document outlines how the Job Scheduler Microservice can be scaled to handle increased load, high availability, and distributed job execution in a production environment.

---

## 1. Horizontal Scaling of API Services
- **Stateless API Layer:**
  - The FastAPI application is stateless; multiple instances can be run behind a load balancer (e.g.AWS ALB).
  - Each instance connects to the same MySQL and Redis backends.
- **API Gateway/Load Balancer:**
  - Can use API gateway or load balancer to distribute incoming HTTP requests across all running API containers/services.

## 2. Distributed Job Scheduling
- **APScheduler with Redis Job Store:**
  - Redis acts as a centralized, persistent job store.
  - Multiple scheduler instances (in different containers or VMs) can share the same Redis backend.
  - Only one instance will acquire the lock and execute a given job at a time, preventing duplicate execution.
- **Failover:**
  - If one scheduler instance fails, others continue processing jobs without interruption.

## 3. Service Decomposition
- **Microservices:**
  - The job scheduler can be split into smaller services for independent scaling and deployment.
  - Each service communicates via REST, gRPC, or message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for advanced workflows.

## 4. Containerization & Orchestration
- **Docker & Kubernetes:**
  - We can containerize all services for consistent deployment.
  - We can use Kubernetes for orchestration, auto-scaling.

## Summary
- We can run multiple API and scheduler instances for high availability.
- We can use Redis for distributed job coordination.
- We can scale the database and background workers as needed.
- We can employ container orchestration for robust, automated scaling and management.

This architecture ensures the Job Scheduler Microservice can handle large-scale, production workloads reliably and efficiently.
